<h1>Frame By Frame Debugger</h1>
<h2>Unreal Engine plugin that lets you record frames during gameplay and replay them for easy and visual debugging</h2> 
</header>
<p class="PortfolioProject">
	I initially created this plugin to support the development of my RTS Movement plugin <b href="RTS.html">[Link]</b>. I felt that the usual methods of debugging were not sufficient because I needed to see how forces interacted with each other and were modified both between frames and within a frame.<br>
	This plugin lets you record frames into a .json file, storing only the changes from the previous frame.<br>
	The .json file contains any data that the user has decided to store each frame.<br>
	A navmesh of the current map is also stored into an .obj file which the plugin then spawns when debugging.<br>
	<b>When watching the replay you can:</b> <br>
	- See the values of each variable <br>
	- Step through arrays <br>
	- Select an actor to see their stored variables<br>
	- Visualize vectors/shapes by checking the draw checkbox<br>
	<br>However, after finishing the plugin, I realized that Unreal already provides similar functionality in its "Visual logger", so this plugin was not released on FAB.
