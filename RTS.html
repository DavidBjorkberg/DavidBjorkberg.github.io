<h1>Pawn Avoidance Behaviour</h1>
</header>
<p class="PortfolioProject">

	This system is based on classic boids avoidance but modified to: <br>
	Make movement more deterministic<br>
	Minimize overlap between pawns<br>
	Prevent pawns from moving outside the navmesh</p>
<header style="text-align: left;">
<h3>General Overview:</h3>
</header>
<p class="PortfolioProject">
<b>1. Initial Direction</b><br>
	- The pawn gets an initial direction towards its destination. <br>
<b>2. Collision Avoidance</b><br>
	- When a pawn gets within a certain range of another pawn, it checks that pawn's position and direction.<br>
	- It then adjusts its own direction to avoid potential collisions.<br>
<b>3. Navmesh Boundary Checking</b><br>
- To ensure it doesn't leave the navmesh, the pawn queries the navmesh for its current polygon and its polygon next frame if it continues the current direction.<br>
- If it is not allowed to move to that polygon, it counts it as terrain and adjusts its direction accordingly.<br>
	<b>Challenge: Balancing Avoidance with Smooth Navigation<b>
	One of the key challenges in this system was modifying each pawn’s direction to avoid collisions and navmesh boundaries while still guaranteeing they reach their destination smoothly.
		The system needed to handle many edge cases. Such as tight spaces, multiple pawns converging, and complex navmesh layouts, without causing jittery or unnatural movement.
		To solve this, the system carefully adjusts avoidance on a frame-by-frame basis, ensuring pawns react smoothly to each other’s movements without avoiding into one another or causing future conflicts.</p> 
<p class="PortfolioProject">
Unreal Engine provides its own avoidance behaviour, however this is too floaty and imprecise to be used in a game where the pawn movement matters heavily. It is more suitable for crowd behaviour that is not central to the gameplay.
