<h1>Pawn Avoidance Behaviour</h1>
</header>
<p class="PortfolioProject">

This is a boids based avoidance system with alterations to make the movement more deterministic, minimize overlap between pawns and to stop movement outside of the navmesh<br>
</p>
<header style="text-align: left;">
<h3>General Overview:</h3>
</header>
<p class="PortfolioProject">
<b>1. Initial Direction</b><br>
	- The pawn gets an initial direction towards its destination. <br>
<b>2. Collision Avoidance</b><br>
	- When a pawn gets within a certain range of another pawn, it checks that pawn's position & direction.<br>
	- It then modifies its own direction to avoid the collision.<br>
<b>3. Navmesh Boundary Checking</b><br>
- To ensure it doesn't leave the navmesh, the pawn queries the navmesh for its current polygon and its polygon next frame if it continues the current direction.<br>
- If it is not allowed to move to that polygon, it counts it as terrain and adjusts its direction accordingly.<br>
</p> 
<p class="PortfolioProject">
Unreal Engine provides its own avoidance behaviour, however this is too floaty and imprecise to be used in a game where the pawn movement matters heavily. It is more suitable for crowd behaviour that is not central to the gameplay.
