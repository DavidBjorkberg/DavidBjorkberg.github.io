<h1>Pawn Avoidance</h1>
</header>
<p class="PortfolioProject">

	<b>This system is based on classic boids avoidance but modified to: </b><br>
	1. Make movement more deterministic<br>
	2. Minimize overlap between pawns<br>
	3. Prevent pawns from moving outside the navmesh<br>
	4. Reliably move the pawn to the destination at the expected speed
</p>

<h3>General Overview:</h3>
</header>
<p class="PortfolioProject">
<b>1. Initial Direction</b><br>
	- The pawn gets an initial direction towards its destination. <br>
<b>2. Collision Avoidance</b><br>
	- When a pawn gets within a certain range of another pawn, it checks that pawn's position and direction.<br>
	- It then adjusts its own direction to avoid potential collisions.<br>
<b>3. Navmesh Boundary Checking</b><br>
- To ensure it doesn't leave the navmesh, the pawn queries the navmesh for its current polygon and its polygon next frame if it continues the current direction.<br>
- If it is not allowed to move to that polygon, it counts it as terrain and adjusts its direction accordingly.<br>

<h3>Challenge: Balancing Avoidance with Smooth Navigation:</h3>
</header>
	One of the key challenges in this system was modifying each pawn’s direction to avoid collisions and navmesh boundaries while still guaranteeing they reach their destination smoothly.<br>
		The system needed to handle many edge cases. Such as tight spaces, multiple pawns converging, and complex navmesh layouts, without causing jittery or unnatural movement.<br>
		To solve this, the system carefully adjusts avoidance on a frame-by-frame basis, ensuring pawns react smoothly to each other’s movements without avoiding into one another or causing future conflicts.</p> <br><br>
<p class="PortfolioProject">
Unreal Engine provides its own avoidance behaviour, however this is too floaty and imprecise to be used in a game where the pawn movement matters heavily. It is more suitable for crowd behaviour that is not central to the gameplay.
