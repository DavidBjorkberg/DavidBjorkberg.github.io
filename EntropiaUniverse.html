<p class="PortfolioProject">
<b>At MindArk, I worked on Entropia Universe, a large-scale sci-fi MMO built in CryEngine, with a codebase developed over 20 years.</b> <br>
	As part of the Engine Team, my primary focus was on developing tech-heavy systems and creating tools for game designers. Helping them work more efficiently and giving them greater control over gameplay features.<br>
	Working with such a long-lived and complex codebase taught me how to effectively navigate and extend large systems, and highlighted the importance of writing robust, maintainable code that follows the projects code standards.<br>
<br>
<b>Examples of features implemented:</b> <br>
	- Implemented an in-game world builder with support for terrain sculpting, texture painting, foliage placement and save/load <br>
	- Reworked the connection lines between nodes in the visual scripting system to improve readability<br>
	- Implemented an orbital camera system<br>
	- Extended CryEngine's editor to improve workflows for game designers and artists<br>
