<p class="PortfolioProject">
At MindArk, I worked on Entropia Universe, a large-scale sci-fi MMO built in CryEngine, with a codebase built over 20 years. 
	I was part of the Engine Team, where my primary focus was on developing tech-heavy systems and creating tools for game designers. Helping them work more efficiently and giving them greater control over gameplay features.
	Working on such a long-lived and complex codebase taught me how to effectively navigate and extend large systems, and highlighted the importance of writing robust, maintainable code that follows the projects code standards.
