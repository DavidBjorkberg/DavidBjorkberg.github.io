<p class="PortfolioProject">
At Piktiv I helped port Goat Simulator Mobile (Android/iOS) from Unreal Engine 3 to Unreal Engine 4.<br>

During this project I learned how to quickly get acquainted with a new codebase. Both the codebase that we ported from, but also the codebase that Piktiv created before I joined the project.<br>

I worked on this project for 8 months and for me it was split up into two parts. For the first part, I implemented gameplay features, systems, etc. For the second part I worked with adding non-gameplay systems, such as achievements, loading screen, and push notifications. During this part i had to quickly learn how to implement iOS specific features using objective-C.<br>

Since the tasks of the project was divided up into gameplay features and not specific disciplines, I was given the opportunity to learn Unreal Engine and many of its subsystems (physics, particle effects, animations, etc).<br>
