<p class="PortfolioProject">
At Piktiv, I worked on porting Goat Simulator Mobile from Unreal Engine 3 to Unreal Engine 4. During this project, I quickly adapted to existing codebases, both the one we ported from and the one created by Piktiv before I joined. <br>

In the first half of the project, I implemented gameplay features and systems, learning Unreal Engine and its subsystems like physics, particle effects, and animations. <br>
In the second half, I focused on non-gameplay systems such as achievements, loading screens, and push notifications, including learning to implement iOS-specific features using Objective-C.
