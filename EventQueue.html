<h1>Event Queue</h1>
<h2>Unreal Engine plugin that allows gameplay logic to be queued, stalled, removed, or reacted to.<br>

<p class="PortfolioProject">
In developing a turn-based game, I created a system to make gameplay more dynamic and manageable <br>
<br>
Initially, I used <b>callbacks and delegates</b> for injecting item-specific logic into the gameplay.
for example if the player had a lifesteal item, i wanted the player to gain health and play a heal animation after dealing damage before continuing with the turn.This approach, however, led to complicated, hard-to-maintain code <br>
<br>
To solve this i created a <b>plugin</b>, where you can encapsulate a piece of gameplay logic in an <b>"Event"</b>.<br>
For example: to create an <b>Attack event</b>, you would simply create an class inheriting from the <b>Event</b> class, place your attack logic inside it and add the event to the <b>Event Queue</b>.<br>
When the queue reaches the <b>Attack event</b>, it executes its logic and then moves to the next Event in the queue.<br>
<br>
<b>All you'd have to do to implement a lifesteal item now is to:</b><br>
1. <b>Subscribe</b> to the delegate that notifies when a new event triggers.<br>
2. When the delegate triggers, <b>insert a heal event</b> as the next Event in the queue. <br>
<br>
Additionally, you can prevent the queue from proceeding to the next Event by adding a <b>"Blocker."</b> As long as an event has at least one blocker, the queue won't move on to the subsequent event.<br>
With these components you can easily create dynamic & latent gameplay that scales well with the project.
