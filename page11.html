                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5"><p><span style="font-size: 2.2rem;"><br></span></p><strong>Project 1: AI Auto-chess(Unity)<br></strong><p><span style="font-size: 2.2rem;">When I joined Spellscaper they had the idea of creating a game where generative AI was incorporated into the gameplay.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>Through discussion we came up with the concept of an auto-chess where all abilities were created by the players, using generative AI. Spellscaper at this point consisted of 3 people; CEO, CTO, and me. With me doing implementing most of the gameplay and AI incorporation, and the CTO focusing more on big picture tech. </p><p>Over the next 7 months we implemented the auto-chess using Unity as our frontend and our own AI focused "engine" as backend. We reached a point where we could generate 2D worlds, Characters and most importantly: Abilities.</p><div>However, generative AI was improving so quickly, that we felt that we didn't utilize its capabilities enough. The concept of player generated abilities wasn't as mind blowing as it was 7 months ago.</div><div>This made us think, what if instead of just generating a specific element of a game, the AI generated the entire game?</div><div><strong>Project 2: AI Powered Platform (Unreal 5)</strong></div>We got the idea of creating a platform where a user could for example type "Give me a gun" and "make it shoot apples", and the player would be given an apple gun. <br>We wanted to create something similar to Roblox, but without an editor and where players could create together online.<br><br>After much discussion we decided to switch to Unreal Engine 5 for this project, because it would be much easier to integrate with the AI because its open source. <br>The reason it was a hard decision to make, was because I was the only one in the company with experience in Unreal. This lead to me being responsible for project structure, making sure best practices were being upheld, etc.&nbsp;<br>Over the following months, we created a working prototype of the platform. A player could enter the game and with a couple sentences have a working football game, with two teams, two goals, a ball and an UI showing the score.&nbsp;<p><br></p><br><p><strong>What I learned</strong></p>- Deeper understanding of Unreal<br>- Rapidly prototype and test ideas<br>- Dig through Unreal source code to find hard to find issues (looking at you, garbage collector)<br><strong>Responsibilities<br></strong><p>- Come up with creative solutions to unorthodox problems</p><p>- Prototype &amp; implement new systems / gameplay features</p></h4>
